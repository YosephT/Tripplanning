                    <p>
                      The Trip Planning team is one of several teams of seniors in computer science at Brandeis University taking an independent study course overseen by Prof. Pito Salas.
                      The independent study consists of several Brandeis teams partnering with businesses and organizations to creatively solve a tech-related problem, and is usually offered each semester.

                    <p>
                      The Trip Planning Project is the result of a collaboration between the City of Boston Mayor's Commission for Persons with Disabilities and a team of four Brandeis University students.
                      The City of Boston was interested in creating a Google Maps transit option for users with disabilities to navigate safely and predictably around Boston and collaborated with the Brandeis students to create a deliverable that fit their needs.

                <p>
                  While beautiful, Boston is an old city that was not built with accessibility in mind - many streets in Boston, especially near Downtown Crossing, are paved with cobblestones, unpredictably sloped, and too narrow.
                  Because of this, navigating around Boston becomes a much more difficult task than it should be, even for people without mobility disabilities.
                  To alleviate the pains of navigating around Boston for people with disabilities, the MBTA provides a service called The Ride, which allows people with disabilities to get on-call transportation from anywhere in Boston for a lower fee than a cab or uber.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ride is an amazing initiative and service, but what about shorter trips to nearby locations like the grocery store?
                  People with disabilities will opt to travel alone rather than take The Ride, and will tend to take routes they know are accessible that they have found through trial-and-error.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the routes people tend to take are tried-and-true paths, when travelling to a location they have never been to before, how can a person know if the path suggested to them by Google Maps is traversable?
                  Similarly, what about visitors to Boston that have never been here before?
                  No well-used maps app or website incorporates accessibility into their directions algorithms, and there is no current system in place for people in the city of Boston to discover new traversable routes.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  This project is a small step in a larger initiative by the City of Boston to increase accessibility.
                  We have attempted to solve the problem of traversable sidewalk routes in Boston and provide a solution for the Commission for Persons with Disabilities to implement and distribute to Boston's residents and visitors.

Knowing the importance of a good database standardization, we concentrated most of our efforts on developing a standardization that would fit our needs.

              We built a basic proof of concept that works with the current dataset that we have been provided, and routes around known barriers.
              It is similar to the <a href="http://bostonaccessible.com">Boston Accessible website</a> that had been previously created by the City of Boston, but instead of just displaying barriers and relying on the user to create their own routes, our implementation automatically routes around known barriers.

              We built our implementation using Google Maps for the mapping functionality, and added routes and barriers on top as ArcGIS layers. ArcGIS is a geographic information system (GIS) for working with maps and geographic information.  The ArcGIS features allowed us to incorporate barriers, both temporary and permanent, that would then re-route the next shortest path from the user’s origin to their destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              In defining barriers, we distinguished between permanent barriers and user-inputted barriers.  Permanent barriers are obstacles that the system determines, based on the data it has about that location, would prevent the user from traveling at that point.
              All of the ramp points are currently plotted as permanent barrier points, which are shown in red icons.  Users are ensured that where there are permanent barriers, the system will never generate a route that would cross those points.  We then added a feature for allowing the user to add his or her own barriers, which are displayed with yellow icons.  The ability for a user to interact with the system in this way is important in cases where there are barriers that do not appear on the map and the user either runs into one or knows that there is one in a certain location.
